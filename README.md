NSM Live Look
=============

Overview
--------

View entries in template context from the ExpressionEngine control panel publish tab and edit entry table

NSM Live Look is a [Multi-Site Manager][ee_msm] compatible[ ExpressionEngine extension][ee_cp_extensions_manager] that allows you to view the latest published revision of an entry in the ExpressionEngine [control panel][ee_cp].

When enabled, a Live Look tab is added to the CP publish form which displays the entry in a rendered template context.

The Problem
-----------

ExpressionEngine implemented 'Live Look' entry previews in version 1.6.1. While a welcome addition, it didnâ€™t quite match my development workflow.

IMHO, problems with the native Live Look are:

* Custom urls are not allowed which forces you to use `/template_group/template/entry_id/`. Being forced to use the `entry_id` doesn't suit my site which uses custom url formats including the {url_title} parameter.
* It doesn't support urls generated by the Pages & Structure modules.
* There is no way to view the entry in the Publish Form.
* The third issue, which isn't related to the native Live Look (but is a general entry 'preview' issue), is there is no way to preview updates to an existing entry before it is "live" even using conventional status work arounds. NSM Publish Plus provides the functionality to save drafts without affecting the current live version. NSM Live Look integrates with NSM Publish plus to provide draft preview in template context.

Features
--------

NSM Live Look has many features to enhance your publishing workflow. They include:

* **Publish Form Live Look tab** - View published entry revisions in template context from the CP publish form. Previewing unpublished changes to entries, viewing drafts and revisions requires NSM Publish Plus.
* **Multi-Site Manager compatible** - Independent extension settings for each site

Getting started
---------------

### Requirements

NSM Live Look has been tested on ExpressionEngine 2.0.1PB1.

Other requirements:

* PHP5
* A modern web browser - Firefox, Safari, Chrome or IE8+

### Download

Download the latest stable release from my website or live on the GitHub edge.

### Installation

The NSM Live Look extension contains an extension and language folder. To install NSM Live Look follow the instructions below:

* [Download][8] the latest stable version of NSM Live Look
2. Extract the .zip file to your desktop
3. Copy `/nsm_live_look/` to your `system/expressionengine/third_party/` directory
4. Activate NSM Live Look in the Module Manager

### Activation

1. Open the Module Manager
2. Enable NSM Live Look
3. Configure NSM Live Look in the extension

Configuration
-------------

NSM Live Look has the following extension settings which need to be entered separately for each Multi-Site Manager site.

Note: All configuration options are site specific. When a new site is created be sure to save the extension settings for the new site to avoid errors.

#### Channel customisation

Each channel has it's own unique settings to add a Live Look tab in the publish / edit form, add a Live Look link in the edit table and display the default Publish Form preview. 

##### Preview URL

    /blog/post/{entry_id}/{url_title}/

The Live Look tab and link will use the entry preview url.

The preview url setting will have the following variables replaced with entry specific attributes allowing you to create highly customisable urls:

* `{url_title}`
* `{entry_id}`
* `{channel_id}`
* `{title}`
* `{author_id}`
* `{status}`
* `{entry_date_day}`
* `{entry_date_month}`
* `{entry_date_year}`
* `{dst_enabled}`
* `{comment_total}`
* `{trackback_total}`
* `{username}`
* `{email}`
* `{screen_name}`

Version notes
-------------

### Upgrading?

* Before upgrading back up your database and site first, you can never be too careful.
* Never upgrade a live site, you're asking for trouble regardless of the addon.
* After an upgrade if you are experiencing errors re-save the extension settings for each site in your ExpressionEngine install.

There are no specific upgrade notes for this version.
